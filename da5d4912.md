# About RTK

I think there are benefits in RTK especially if you want to handwrite kanji, and
also some people struggle much more than others at identifying the small
differences in the squiggly lines of symbols so it might be useful to some and
less useful to others.

However I think it's a real mess to tell people to do all 2000 jouyou kanji just
to "get used to how kanji look", for the most part with just 1000 kanji you can
already "read" (or at least recognize) more than 90% of everyday written text,
and when you do RTK up to that point you'll probably already have a decent grasp
on how kanji kinda look like (radicals, components, etc)
