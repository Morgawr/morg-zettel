# Onyomi and Kunyomi

The question of "**How do I read this kanji?**" is a common point of confusion
among beginners of Japanese.

The truth is: for every kanji you encounter there will always be multiple ways
to read it depending on how it gets used in a sentence. This is because **kanji
aren't words**. The individual words carry the actual connotation of
pronunciation with them, not the individual kanji.

## "Japanese" words

Due to the need to adopt a completely foreign logographic writing system over
their own native language, when Japanese came across kanji they merged them on
top of the already existing words that were spoken at the time.

These *Japanese words* are called <ruby>和語<rt>わご</rt></ruby> (Japanese words).
The choice of which kanji to use to represent which word was based on which
meaning was originally assigned to each symbol in Chinese, but the pronunciation
was kept the same as the original Japanese one.

As a (likely historically inaccurate) example:

The word たべる (to eat) got assigned the kanji 食 which meant “meal” or “food”
 in Chinese, and it became <ruby>食<rt>た</rt></ruby>べる. This was completely
independent from the Chinese pronunciation of the morpheme 食.

This is called a <ruby>訓読<rt>くんよ</rt></ruby>み (Japanese reading) for the
kanji 食.

If you notice, <ruby>訓読<rt>くんよ</rt></ruby>み often have a "stem" or base in
kanji and some extra hiragana attached at the end. When this happens, their reading
will often be represented with a dot or a pair of parentheses in a dictionary.

For example:

食 → た.べる or た(べる)


## "Chinese" words

To make things more complicated, people weren’t happy with just having kanji
represent the original Japanese words. Due to the strong cultural and religious
influence of China, they actually took and assimilated *Chinese words*, phrases,
and proverbs into Japanese.

As a part of this process, due to the need to import Chinese pronunciation into
the Japanese phonetic system, they ended up creating separate readings that
deviated significantly from their original Chinese versions.

These words are called <ruby>漢語<rt>かんご</rt></ruby> (Chinese words). They
are usually (but not always!) compounds of multiple kanji together (called <ruby>熟語<rt>じゅくご</rt></ruby>).

To continue with the earlier example, the kanji 食 is used in the word <ruby>食事<rt>しょくじ</rt></ruby>
(meal) and is read しょく・じ. しょく being the <ruby>音読<rt>おんよ</rt></ruby>み
(Chinese reading) of the kanji 食.

In dictionaries, it is common to represent <ruby>音読<rt>おんよ</rt></ruby>み
in katakana. For example:

食 → ショク


## Multiple readings

Without going into many details on the why, it is important to acknowledge the
fact that it is very common for kanji to have multiple <ruby>音<rt>おん</rt></ruby>
and sometimes even <ruby>訓<rt>くん</rt></ruby> readings to them. This is
because when kanji were imported from China, they came into Japan at very
different times in history, and with them they carried different phonetics of
the Chinese dialect(s). The kanji themselves also went through significant
enough changes over the years that words often acquired extremely irregular or
distorted readings.

This is why it's sometimes **impossible** to know how a word written in kanji is
actually pronounced if you don't already know it, and why it's necessary instead
to use furigana or consult a dictionary.

<hr />

You can think of <ruby>音読<rt>おんよ</rt></ruby>み and <ruby>訓読<rt>くんよ</rt></ruby>み
as the equivalent of Latin and Greek roots for most modern European languages.
