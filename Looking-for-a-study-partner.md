# Looking for a study partner

A lot of people find it hard to stay motivated to learn Japanese, so they go
look for a study partner or someone else they can study with and hold each other
accountable. They are convinced it will help them stick to a routine and finally
get them through the hurdles of language learning.

**Pros**:

 * None. Seriously, there’s literally no good points.

**Cons**:

Everyone has different language learning goals and interest/focus areas. For
this reason, language learning with a fixed study partner usually becomes one
of these two situations:
 * them being slower than you, so you have to slow down your learning and/or
   feel frustrated that you're not doing as much as you could, until you feel
   demotivated
 * them being faster than you, so they have to slow down for you and get
   frustrated, or you might feel resentful that you aren't "as good as them"

Also, as you both would be language beginners, there’s not much you could learn
from each other anyway.

**Conclusion:** Don’t get a study partner, it’s a really bad idea. If you need
people to chat about studying Japanese or to ask for advice, there’s some great
discord servers for language exchange (like [[EJLX]]). Or you can find a tutor
on websites like [italki.com](https://italki.com) instead (ideally a native
speaker).
