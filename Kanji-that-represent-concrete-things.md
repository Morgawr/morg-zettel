<ruby>象形文字<rt>しょうけいもじ</rt></ruby> are the most “primitive” of kanji.
While their modern rendition in kanji form may have changed quite significantly
and we might need some imagination to properly understand what they represent,
if you look at their original representation in [oracle bone script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_bone_script)
or [seal script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seal_script), the similarities
become more obvious.

This said, the idea is very simple, 木 looks like a tree, and it means tree. 目
looks like an eye, and it means eye, etc.

## Examples

There are a lot of these and writing all of them would be outside the scope of
this article, but I have listed a few of them with increasing complexity just to
give you an idea of what to expect:

 * 人
   * It’s a man. I mean, look at it. It’s a man.
 * 雨
   * Droplets are falling from the sky. It means rain.
 * 車
   * It’s supposed to be a cart pulled by a horse (later, a car). Also, it looks
     like a wheel rotating around an axle. In fact, it also means wheel.
 * 母
   * It looks like a pair of breasts. It means mother.
 * 永
   * It represents a large river that is split into multiple tributaries. A big
     river with a lot of long branches. Its meaning is “long” and, in more
     specific terms, that of “eternity”.

## Exceptions

Same as above, some of these might not be very intuitive on a first look, but
once you attribute a story to them they can be equally easy to remember. There
are **a lot** of exceptions, but here are a few examples:

 * 業
   * Originally, it was supposed to be a rack for hanging decorative musical
     instruments. Later, it became the symbol of a writing board, which then
     evolved into a meaning of education or skilled craftsmanship, and
     eventually fossilized into its modern usage of “artwork” or “business”.
 * 以
   * Its original shape (耜) was a bit different from this. It is modeled to
     represent agricultural machinery. It later assumed the more general meaning
     of “by means of”.
