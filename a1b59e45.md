# Methods to Achieve Japanese Learning Independence

As described in [[58465ab9]], achieving learning independence is fundamental to
unlocking language acquisition.

The most important thing is being able to navigate the vast amount of resources
available to you on the Internet without getting lost or incorrect advice.

These are the resources, tools, and steps that I follow whenever I get stumped
by something new in Japanese that I cannot understand.

## What does \<unknown word\> mean?

Check the dictionary:
  - [Jisho](https://jisho.org/) is the best J-E online dictionary available.
  - [Goo](https://dictionary.goo.ne.jp/) is a very useful J-J online dictionary.
  - [Nicovideo](https://dic.nicovideo.jp/) has a decent **slang** dictionary.
  - And so does [Pixiv](https://dic.pixiv.net/)

## What is the difference between \<word1\> and \<word2\>?

 - Look the two words up in a J-E [dictionary](https://jisho.org)
 - Look up the definitions for both words in a [J-J dictionary](https://dictionary.goo.ne.jp)
   - This is very important because often the J-E dictionary won't be detailed
     enough to point out nuances and slight differences between synonyms
 - Google `「word1」 「word2」 どう違う` and read the (usually) Japanese explanation
 - Use [[7507c939]] to check how the two words differ in context with real
   sentences and usage

## What does \<particle\> or \<grammar\> mean?

 - Use the online indexed version of [A Handbook of Japanese Grammar Patterns](https://core6000.neocities.org/hjgp/)
   to search for the grammar point you are unsure about
 - alternatively, use the online indexed version of [Dictionary of Japanese Grammar](https://core6000.neocities.org/dojg/)
 - Search for `「<grammar>」意味` on Google and read the (usually) Japanese results

## How to pronounce \<word\>?

 - [Forvo](https://forvo.com) is a huge repository of recordings of native
   speakers reading words out loud.
 - [Youglish](https://youglish.com/japanese) is an amazing site that lets you
   search for a word in a youtube video as it is being used in context by a
   (usually) native speaker. It is also a great way to find native listening
   material.
 - [OJAD](http://www.gavo.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ojad/eng/pages/home) is an online
   [pitch accent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6AoilGEers) dictionary for
   Japanese.
