# neuron.vim

To write these notes/site I am using
[neuron.vim](https://github.com/ihsanturk/neuron.vim). However, I keep
forgetting the [keybinds](https://github.com/ihsanturk/neuron.vim/blob/master/doc/neuron.vim.txt)
as I haven't gotten fully used to them yet.

This is a good place as any to store them somewhere that I can easily access
and consult at a later time.

## Bindings
