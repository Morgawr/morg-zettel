# 漢語 (Chinese-origin) vs 和語 (Japanese-origin) word table


<5e00df06> takes a lot from Chinese in its origin, as the language was shaped
on top of the kanji writing system (<99eaf9c2>) in its history. However, on the
other hand, the kanji writing system was also adapted on top of the already
existing spoken Japanese language.

This gave birth to two sets of words/compound phrases to say similar things in
the language. These are so-called [漢語](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%BC%A2%E8%AA%9E#Japanese)
(かんご, chinese + language) and [和語](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%92%8C%E8%AA%9E)
(わご, japanese + language) words.

## Differences

漢語 words are usually written as kanji compounds and usually read the Chinese
way (音読み), whereas 和語 words are usually written as single kanji +
おくりがな and read the Japanese way (訓読み), although this is not a *hard*
*rule*, there are exceptions.

A lot of 漢語 verbs take する and usually have a 和語 counterpart which may or
may not have a slightly different meaning. 漢語 する verbs are usually used in
more official situations and sound more fancy/stiff, whereas 和語 words are
simpler and easier to the ear. However, it is normal in everyday Japanese
speech to use either in equal frequency so both options should be studied and
remembered equally.

## Comparison Table

The following is a table of 和語 vs 漢語 words that I'm compiling as I come
across them in my studies. It is not exhaustive, but so far I haven't been able
to find a similar comprehensive resource so it'll have to do.

For 和語 verbs, I list either transitive or intransitive form as I see fit, but
keep in mind that it doesn't really matter, it works either way. What's
important to keep in mind is the kanji+おくりがな pairing vs the jukugo pair in
漢語.

| 和語       | 漢語       |
|------------|------------|
| 加わる     | 参加する   |
| 変わる     | 変化する   |
| 止まる     | 停止する   |

**NOTE**: As mentioned above, meanings may not map 1:1 as 漢語 words usually
carry some additional nuance (due to the more complex nature of 熟語), so it
should only be taken at face value.
