# Using Duolingo

Duolingo is one of the (unfortunately) most popular language learning apps these
days. Everyone instantly thinks about using Duolingo the first time they decide
to learn a new language.

**Pros**:

 * It’s (allegedly) okay at teaching you hiragana and katakana

**Cons**:
 * Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Z20ZPIDak)
 * Duolingo **actually teaches you wrong Japanese**. It is not able to deal with
   compound readings and peculiarities of kanji. As an example: it teaches you
   that the word お腹 is read おはら because of the reading 腹 alone, and
   ignores the お in front of it that completely changes the sound. The word is
   actually read おなか.
 * The “human-like” phonetic system they use is not able to deal well with
   intonation and pitch accent of certain words or phrases. It actually teaches
   you bad and unnatural pronunciation
 * It is unable to deal with the complex context-heavy nuance of the Japanese
   language when compared to English. Most of the phrases it teaches you are
   awkward, weird, or unnatural. Some of the explanations are flat out confusing
   and sometimes even incorrect.

**Conclusion:** **STAY AWAY FROM DUOLINGO**. It’s decent at learning hiragana
and katakana, but there’s so many resources out there to teach you those that I
believe you shouldn’t even bother with giving the app your patronage. The less
people use that terrible app, the better it would be for the entire world. Plus,
you won’t risk accidentally getting addicted to their shitty system. Just don’t
use it. Uninstall it now.
