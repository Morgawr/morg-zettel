I see this phenomenon often and while unfortunately I don't know what might help
specifically, one thing that I always like to bring up is the fact that for
these words often there aren't "multiple meanings" but it's more like there's
"multiple ways to translate them" (based on context) into English. **A lot** of
times (admittedly, not always), there is no clear cut "**which** meaning is it?"
kind of question with a clear answer, and worrying about that is just going to
muddy up your understanding of the language and its nuance.

Try to think of it from the opposite point of view. Imagine you're a Japanese
person reading an English sentence. As you know 分かる and 知る can both mean
"to know". Imagine you're Japanese and see this sentence: "I don't know him at
all". And  then you ask "What meaning is used for 'know' here? Is it 知る or
分かる?"

The answer is... it's neither. Or at least, it doesn't matter. The word is
"know" because we use "know" in that sentence in English.

Maybe this gives you a better understanding what I'm talking about, but generally
speaking, in a lot of words in Japanese you have these multiple meanings but they
really all mean the same thing. You need to try and internalize all those
meanings into a general understanding of what the word **represents**, and for
each of us I feel that's a different thing. Some people imagine a scene in their
head. Some a picture. Some a sound, a color, an emotion, etc. All I know for
sure is that no matter how much time you spend on a dictionary (either J-E or
even J-J), you will never "get" the word and its internalized meaning until you
actually spend enough time **with the real language** to get a more thorough
*personal* understanding of it. That's the moment where  you really stop
translating and just let the words create scenes in your mind. It happens at
different times for different people, maybe someone smarter than me can give you
more useful tips, sorry.
