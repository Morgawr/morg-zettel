If you you’ve gotten to this point, you probably noticed I mentioned in [[Kanji-Classification]]
that there are six categories of kanji called <ruby>六書<rt>りくしょ</rt></ruby>,
however we’ve only focused on four main ones.

The reason for this is because the original division by the scholar Xu Shen a
couple thousand years ago is simply not useful to most people learning kanji for
a practical purpose. The first four classifications that we already introduced
pertain to the composition/shape of the kanji. They give us an insight into the
meanings (and readings) of the kanji based on their shape.

The last two categories on the other hand pertain to the kanji **usage** and the
history behind them. They also aren’t mutually exclusive to the other four
categories. They are closer to some meta-analysis of Kanji etymology than
the rest.

## 転注文字 - Kanji with additional acquired meanings

<ruby>転注文字<rt>てんちゅうもじ</rt></ruby> are kanji that originally had a
certain meaning, however due to extensive usage in the language, they ended up
acquiring additional meanings for all kinds of reasons.

To give you a couple of quick examples:

 * 楽 in its original form (樂) was a <ruby>象形文字<rt>ぞうけいもじ</rt></ruby>
   depicting a musical instrument made of wood (木) and strings (糸) and had the
   meaning of “music”. However, the act of listening to music became associated
   with the idea of fun (たのしい) and happiness (らく) so the kanji also
   acquired the meaning of “happiness” or “fun” (<ruby>楽<rt>たの</rt></ruby>しい).
   Note that the original meaning of music is obviously still valid as well
   (See: <ruby>音楽<rt>おんがく</rt></ruby>).
 * 労 in its original form (勞) was a <ruby>会意文字<rt>かいいもじ</rt></ruby>
   depicting strength (力) employed in extinguishing a fire from a burning house
   (𤇾 which is the short form of 熒) and this act leaves you exhausted. The
   original meaning was “tiredness” or “hard work”. However, it eventually also
   assumed the meaning of “showing gratitude for someone’s hard work” (ねぎらう).

## 仮借文字 - Kanji that changed meaning due to phonetic loans

<ruby>仮借文字<rt>かしゃくもじ</rt></ruby> are kanji that in ancient times
(often before their arrival into Japan) had a different meaning, but due to the
fact that they sounded similar to other more common words (that were likely
easier to write), they changed meaning to reflect those other words instead.

This is a phenomenon that is not that different from that of [[Ateji]], however
much older.

As a consequence of this, their shape usually has no relevance to their meaning,
however they can still often represent certain specific phonemes or phonetic
components if they appear in other kanji as <ruby>形声文字<rt>けいせいもじ</rt></ruby>.

For example, the two kanji 来 (coming) and 麦 (wheat) originally had different
meanings, and they swapped them for each other.

On the one hand, 来 meant wheat and was a <ruby>象形文字<rt>ぞうけいもじ</rt></ruby>
as its old form (來) clearly shows awns of wheat being left to possibly dry. On
the other hand, 麦 meant “coming” and was originally a <ruby>形声文字<rt>けいせいもじ</rt></ruby>
(old form: 麥) having 來 at the top for sound, and 夊 at the bottom for meaning
(it’s a foot).

Since “coming” was a more common word than “wheat” and the kanji 來 was much
simpler to write while carrying the same sound, the two symbols ended up
swapping places. Now 来 means “coming” and 麦 means “wheat”.
