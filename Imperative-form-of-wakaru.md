# Imperative form of 分かる

There's nothing really special here but it's kinda unusual. 分かる is a verb
that behaves the same as a potential verb. Meaning that 分かる is not a volitional
action, but it's rather a state someone is in that cannot be controlled.

For this reason, using the imperative form can come across as a bit odd
logically. It's kinda hard to tell someone to "become able to do X" as an order,
however for 分かる it kinda works in the right context.

Here's a couple of examples:

[![分かれ example](./static/wakare2.png)](./static/wakare2.png)

The first sentence, in the context, is a character frustrated that no one
understands him and he's lashing out by saying "understand me! understand me!".

The second picture is using the common grammar `<imperative>と言う` which means
to tell someone to do something. In this case he's complaining that he's being
told to (try to) understand the pain of others by someone else.
