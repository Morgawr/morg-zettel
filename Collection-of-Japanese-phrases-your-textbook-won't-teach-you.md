# Collection of Japanese phrases your textbook won't teach you

There is often a big disconnect between the grammar points that are taught in
textbooks and actual Japanese you will find in the wild. This is not to say
grammar study is useless or that textbooks don't teach you "real" Japanese, but
it's just a fact of how languages evolve naturally and how native speakers like
to break the rules of grammar fairly often.

I jokingly call these grammar points **N0 Grammar** because they don't show up
on the [[6adb84e3]]. It has nothing to do with their difficulty however. Some
might be tricky and some might be very easy to understand as soon as you see
them.

Below is a list of these common points with an attempted explanation of how
they work. I don't expect my explanations to be formally correct, especially
from a linguist point of view, and you should not take them as such. Especially
when it comes to slang native speakers might have different perspectives too.

They are just general examples of things I've seen myself in immersion that made
me go "huh, interesting".
