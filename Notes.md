# Notes

As mentioned from the home page:

The majority of these notes and drafts are of my authoring, however sometimes
I stumble upon some really interesting stuff written by other people that I want
to note down or keep in mind to further expand on them in the future. In that
case, I make sure to always attribute the original author as best as I can.

Keep in mind that while there is some minimal amount of curating for the
tone, language, and lack of context, I try to keep it to a minimum. For this
reason, a lot of these notes appear disconnected or rambling.

## Navigating Notes

Each note has a generic topic and platform of origin, and as per zettelkasten
best practices should always be linking to a parent note (or a top-level section
like this one) for easier navigation.

You can look at these two platforms and their note aggregates:

 * [[[Reddit-Notes]]]
 * [[[Discord-Notes]]]

Or you can browse the entry note topics timeline:

[[z:zettels?tag=note-top/**&note-top]]
