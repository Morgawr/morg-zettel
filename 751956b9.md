# VIM

> Vim is a highly configurable text editor built to make creating and changing
> any kind of text very efficient.

It is probably one of the most famous text editors among programmers and
developers (competing with [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)).

Known for its steep learning curve, it is extremely powerful and versatile once
you actually get to know how to use it and navigate its plethora of resources
and plugins.
