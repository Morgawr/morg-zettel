# List of Bad Ideas for Japanese Study

If you have been linked to this page, it's probably because one of the following
points applies to you. You may disagree with what is written here, and that's
normal, if not even expected. Things are rarely so black and white, and some
things might feel like they work for you but don't for other people.

Generally speaking, it's good to follow whatever you find comfortable and
enjoyable when it comes to language learning (see:
[[Optimal-Reading-Immersion---Narrow-Reading]]), however this needs to come from
a position of informed reasoning.

In the following list, I explain why I believe these ideas about how to study
Japanese are not good (or even **bad**). With the right amount of moderation and
openmindedness, try to think wheteher or not this applies to you as well.
