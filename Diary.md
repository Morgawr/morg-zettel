# Diary

This is the entry level for any kind of personal musing, article, writing, or
daily life logging.

I've always wanted to keep a diary, and I never really had the chance to. While
I don't think my life is exciting enough to warrant writing about it, especially
on the world wide web, I can still try and write things that float in my mind
every once in a while I guess.

## Japanese Yearly Immersion Reports

Since 2022 I started keeping track of what media I consume in Japanese and how
my progress is going. Here is a list of articles in decreasing chronological
order:

 - [[Japanese-2025-in-Review]]
 - [[Japanese-2024-in-Review]]
 - [[Japanese-2023-in-Review]]
 - [[Japanese-2022-in-Review]]

## Japanese Reading Reports

Reading reports are (best effort) weekly reports of stuff I've been reading
every week. They involve a short summary, a few notes, and some time-tracking
attempts at quantizing my time split for personal interest over time.

NOTE: I stopped doing weekly reports. I might start again one day, but I just
didn't have enough time.
