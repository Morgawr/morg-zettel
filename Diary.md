# Diary

This is the entry level for any kind of personal musing, article, writing, or
daily life logging.

I've always wanted to keep a diary, and I never really had the chance to. While
I don't think my life is exciting enough to warrant writing about it, especially
on the world wide web, I can still try and write things that float in my mind
every once in a while I guess.

## Japanese Reading Reports

Reading reports are (best effort) weekly reports of stuff I've been reading
every week. They involve a short summary, a few notes, and some time-tracking
attempts at quantizing my time split for personal interest over time.
