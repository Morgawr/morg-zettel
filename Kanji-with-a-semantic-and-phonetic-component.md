# 形声文字 - Kanji with a semantic and phonetic component

The last typology of kanji is also the most prolific one, and in my opinion the
most interesting among them. It accounts for over 90% of kanji so being familiar
with how it works will be extremely beneficial to both your understanding and
memorization.

<ruby>形声文字<rt>けいせいもじ</rt></ruby> are kanji that are composed of two
main components. One part (called <ruby>意符<rt>いふ</rt></ruby>) will tell you
a general semantic idea about the kanji’s meaning (Is it a body part? Does it
pertain to water? Is it food? etc). The other part (called <ruby>音符<rt>おんぷ</rt></ruby>)
will instead give you some hints on how that kanji will be pronounced
**in onyomi**.

If we look at the kanji 町 (city/town/street), the left side (田) tells us what
the kanji is about, the right side will tell us how it’s pronounced (丁, チョウ).
The 田 semantic component originally comes from あぜ<ruby>道<rt>みち</rt></ruby>
which are raised footpaths that demarcate the boundaries between rice paddies
(hence, street).

Keep in mind that not all parts of a <ruby>形声文字<rt>けいせいもじ</rt></ruby>
will relate to the meaning. I’ve seen a lot of confused explanations about kanji
treating them all as <ruby>会意文字<rt>かいいもじ</rt></ruby> and making up a
story about why a <ruby>形声文字<rt>けいせいもじ</rt></ruby> uses a certain
component or not. **Some components just exist to impart a phonetic reading**,
they have nothing to do with the **meaning**. It’s good to remember that.

## Three types of 形声文字

Truth be told, the classification of <ruby>形声文字<rt>けいせいもじ</rt></ruby>
can be further split into three different subgroups.

In the first group, we have kanji that, thanks to their phonetic components,
end up having the same reading:
 * **紙**(シ) = 糸 + **氏**(シ)
 * **姉**(シ) = 女 + **市**(シ)
 * **理**(リ) = 王 + **里**(リ)

In the second group, we have kanji that produce a very similar sound with a
similar component:
 * 村(ソン) = 木 + 寸(スン)
 * 暑(ショ) = 日 + 者(シャ)

In the third group, we have kanji that only differ from each other by their へん
radical (left-side semantic component) but keep the same sound:
 * 板 and 坂 are both pronounced ハン
 * 講 and 構 are both pronounced コウ

## Examples

Let’s look at some more examples and see if we can recognize some patterns:
 * 語 (language/word)
   * The semantic component is 言, it means the kanji relates to language
   * The phonetic component is 吾 and is read ゴ
 * 村 (village)
   * The semantic component is 木, it means this kanji relates to something that
     has to do with trees or woods (think of wooden houses)
   * The phonetic component is 寸 which is usually read スン, but in this kanji
     it becomes the onyomi ソン
 * 説 (opinion/theory)
   * Again, the semantic component here is 言, as this also relates to language
   * The phonetic component is 兌 which is originally read エツ and becomes セツ
     in this kanji.
 * 泡 (bubble)
   * 氵 is the water (水) radical, and we know this kanji relates to water
   * 包 is the phonetic component and is read ホウ
 * 飽 (satiate, tired of)
   * 食 is the semantic component, we know it’s a word  that relates to food
   * 包 once again is the phonetic component and is read ホウ

## A note on learning readings

There is this common misconception that learning kanji readings is a waste of
time because there are too many of them and they are too irregular, and you’re
better off learning words instead. While it is true that there is no one rule
you can learn to get 100% accuracy when reading kanji aside from just… well,
learning the words, if you learn how phonetic components work you can train your
intuition and become really good at guessing readings even of kanji you’ve never
seen before. It’s an extremely valuable trick to keep in mind.

According to [some frequency analysis](https://namakajiri.net/nikki/testing-the-power-of-phonetic-components-in-japanese-kanji/#comment-209324),
if you learned how these components work, you would be able to accurately predict
phonetically **almost a quarter of all words in wikipedia articles** (constrained
to joyo kanji list) even if you had never seen them before.

## Consistency of readings

Unfortunately, as we’ve already seen in other kanji classes, nothing is ever
simple. Kanji have been introduced to Japan at different points in time from
different dialects of Chinese. They also went through significant phonetic and
morphologic changes through history thanks to how the language evolved. This
means that not all kanji will have regular readings from said phonetic components.
There have been some really interesting [research](https://namakajiri.net/nikki/testing-the-power-of-phonetic-components-in-japanese-kanji/)
on how accurate we can be when predicting kanji readings and it turns out that
some specific phonetic components will **always** be read a certain way, whereas
some others are much more inconsistent.

**Note**: when we talk about consistency we specifically mean <ruby>音読<rt>おんよ</rt>み</ruby>
consistency, <ruby>訓読<rt>くんよ</rt>み</ruby> are a completely different
topic that cannot be explained by phonetic components. Also, the process of [rendaku](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/rendaku/)
can happen to pretty much any kanji regardless of their phonetic component so we
can’t do much about that.

## Phonetic Series

I really recommend giving the [original article](https://namakajiri.net/nikki/testing-the-power-of-phonetic-components-in-japanese-kanji/)
a read, but I’ll try to summarize it here in a few sentences.

As a quick rundown, after performing some analysis on the shape and phonetics of
the kanji, we are able to identify certain kanji primitives that will give us a
certain predictive accuracy for their reading.

There are two values to keep in mind when analyzing a phonetic series:
 * The readings coverage
 * Extra readings

The readings **coverage** is how many kanji sharing the same component also
share a certain sound in **any** of their readings.

On the other hand, **extra readings** are kanji with more than one onyomi that
share the same component.

Obviously, if we can identify a component that has no extra readings and 100%
reading coverage, it means that **every single time** we see that component in
an <ruby>音読<rt>おんよ</rt></ruby>み compound, we’ll know with 100% certainty
(minus rendaku rules) how it will be read. We call this a **perfect series**.

This is a **huge** advantage when you are trying to memorize kanji readings,
and it effectively turns certain phonetic components into the equivalent of
letters of the alphabet, which is exactly what we want.

Here are some examples of perfect series (but really, read the original article,
it’s really good):

 * 包 (ホウ) → 包 抱 泡 砲 胞 飽
 * 付 (フ) → 付 府 符 腐 附
 * 司(シ) → 伺 司 嗣 詞 飼
 * 冓(コウ) → 冓 媾 搆 構 溝 篝 覯 講 購 遘
 * 采(サイ) → 彩 採 菜 采
 * 票(ヒョウ) → 剽 嫖 慓 標 漂 瓢 票 縹 飃 飄 驃 鰾
 * 亢(コウ) → 亢 伉 吭 坑 抗 杭 航 頏

It’s amazing, isn’t it? Let me reiterate: **if you know the onyomi of one of**
**those kanji, you will know with 100% accuracy the onyomi of all of those kanji in the series**.
This is an insane life hack to boost your language reading ability.
