# Japanese Learning Loop

No matter what approach you are looking at, to achieve fluency in a language the
most important thing is being able to achieve **learning independence**. ([[[a1b59e45]]])
In other words, being able to sustain your own studies and maintain a tangible
process of consistent self-improvement feedback loop.

The basis of this *language acquisition* loop, I argue, are the same for any
language but the specifics may differ.

This is my proposed approach towards learning [[5e00df06]], I hope it can be
useful to you as it has been (and still is) to me.

## Diagram

**NOTE**: The image has clickable links embedded. Click to expand the image to

While the diagram looks very simplistic, this is done purposefully.

Every person has different preferences when approaching language studies and,
while we all share the same baseline, we may prefer one way or the other.

At the end of the day, you should consider this loop as a loose guideline on
how to orient yourself in the landscape of Japanese learning, and learn to
take advantage of the various [[[9f88358f]]] at your disposal.

## Step 0: Foundation

Do not skip this step. It's really simple, just learn ひらがな and カタカナ.

You really *really* **really** ***NEED*** this.

## Step 1: Basics

The three areas of **Grammar**, **Vocabulary**, and **Listening** should be
done more or less at the same time, they are independent and somewhat parallel,
 they will all equally help you unlock the path to the next stage, when
you are ready.

### Grammar

You want be able to recognize word boundaries, what particles are, how to
conjugate basic verbs, how to express the very basics of ideas, etc.

There's many resources to be consulted at this step. The most common one is to
read [Tae Kim's Grammar Guide](http://www.guidetojapanese.org/learn/complete/),
or if you want a more structured approach you can try a textbook like Genki or
Japanese for Busy People.
<!-- TODO: Write Zettel on Tae Kim -->

What is important to remember here is that you are the one to decide how far you
want to take this structured approach. However, don't linger too long on this,
**the best way to learn grammar is to actually consume native material until
your brain gets the intuition for it.** This is only a stepping stone to get
you there.

### Vocabulary

Knowing what words mean and how they are supposed to look is as important as
knowing when/how to use them.

I won't tell you to skip the next (optional) step because it seems very
beneficial for a lot of people, however I did not do it and I'm not very excited
about it, but I'm writing this down anyway in order to not deprive you of
anything that might help you. Just realize that it's *not mandatory* and if you
aren't into it, you can skip it without issues.

#### Optional: RTK

[Remembering The Kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembering_the_Kanji_and_Remembering_the_Hanzi)
is a method of studying kanji ([[99eaf9c2]]) to become familiar with the various
shapes and loose meaning for each and every glyph. This is to supposedly make it
easier for you to later learn the actual words as you encounter them for real.

**This does not teach you any words**, it merely teaches you the overall *idea*
and *meaning* of the symbols.

<!-- TODO: Write Zettel on RTK -->

#### Anki Core Deck

The purpose of a starting core deck for <6cfc2b98> is to get you started with
basic words that you absolutely need to be able to start reading native material
on your own. Later you will be building your own deck as you learn new words, so
don't get too attached to this one, it is but a starting point to get your feet
wet in *useful* Japanese.

There's various starting decks for beginners, the most commonly recommended is
the so-called [core6k deck](https://mega.nz/#!QIQywAAZ!g6wRM6KvDVmLxq7X5xLrvaw7HZGyYULUkT_YDtQdgfU).

Don't get too hung up on finishing the whole deck (it's going to take you a
very long time), but adding a good 500-1000 words to your toolbelt will take you
a very long way and help you immensely for the next step.

Alternatively, if you want a deck that gets you up-to-speed faster, I recommend
the [VNCore1250 deck](https://mega.nz/#!GiAQzY7C!ZDTQH1Kl23E-UaVAWJWFKPe4Jx_Qk1moAvj2OnPNPto).
It contains the ~1200 most frequent words in Visual Novels. This also carries
over really well for anime, manga, and videogames too.

One tip for <6cfc2b98> in general is to change the default settings, because
they are horrible. See: <31f3d49a>


### Listening

There is no actual step for listening. It's always good to get acquainted with
the phonetics and sound of the language, the pacing of sentences, the modulation
or pitch accents of words, etc. However at this stage you can do mostly only
passive listening, as you lack both the grammar and vocabulary to immerse in
anything yet. If you want, listen to Japanese music, leave some podcasts in the
background... it won't hurt, but don't expect to get much out of it.

## Step 2: The Loop

**The Loop** consists of three fundamental steps, and one preparatory step.

### Sentence Mining Deck (preparation)

There's an [overall guide](https://massimmersionapproach.com/table-of-contents/stage-1/jp-quickstart-guide/#sentence-cards)
on sentence mining and sentence cards on the MIA website.

The idea is that you read native material, find stuff that you don't know, and
add it to this deck so you can review it later.

Once you have set up your mining deck and got the [workflow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfvDKgNUSi8)
down, you can begin *looping*.

### Discovery Phase

Following Krashen's [Input Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_hypothesis),
we acquire language as we are exposed to **comprehensible input**.

Defining comprehensible input, is quite tricky, but in layman's terms it simply
means don't bite more than you can chew. You might be tempted to jump into
complex material that interests you, but you are not going to have a good time
if you cannot find a good balance between consumption and dictionary lookups.

Ideally you want to find material that gives you at least 90% comprehension.
Having to look up one word or grammar point for every sentence is a healthy
balance in my opinion. I'd recommend staying away from material specifically
targeted to language learners (fake conversations, textbook readings, etc). Aim
for kid's material if you're a beginner, instead.

For possible starting points, refer to <e50a5ae3>.

### Consumption Phase

Once you have found what you want to consume, simply start reading.

I say *reading* here but there's multiple ways to consume native content. Do not
skip on listening too. There's all kind of native sources, both passive and
active (as listed on the diagram).

### Improvement Phase

Whenever you find some word or grammar you do not understand, look it up using
the approaches explained in <a1b59e45>.

As you see fit, add these new words or sentences to your sentence mining deck,
and repeat. When you run out of material, go back to the **Discovery Phase**
and find something new to consume.

## Step 3: Fluency

As you see from the diagram, there's really no state that can objectively lead
you to actual fluency. This is because fluency means different things for
different people and its objective definition is not something you should be
concerned about. Just keep repeating *The Loop* and never stop.
