# Getting Started with Pitch Accent

Watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6AoilGEers) video, it's 10 minutes
long and will give you a quick summary of what you need to know.

Then go [here](https://kotu.io/tests/pitchAccent/minimalPairs) and try to do the
test and see if you can pick up the pitch accent of words. If you can't, I
recommend doing that test every day (or whatever) to practice until you get a
good score
