Simply speaking, <ruby>会意文字<rt>かいいもじ</rt></ruby> are kanji made of
multiple individual components that, when put together, end up assuming a larger
meaning. Often these kanji can tell us some kind of story, or we can use a
mnemonic to better remember their shape and meaning at the same time. 休 looks
like a man (人 -> 亻) resting under a tree (木) and it means “to rest”.

## Examples

Same as with <ruby>象形文字<rt>ぞうけいもじ</rt></ruby>, these kanji have also
gone through a lot of simplifications and changes, so some of these examples
might not be super obvious immediately.

 * 森
   * 木 + 木 + 木 = forest!
 * 明
   * 日 + 月. The sun and the moon are bright. It means bright.
 * 男
   * 田 (field) + 力 (strength). Men use their strength to work the field.
 * 位
   * 人 (亻, person) + 立 (to stand up). It means place (among people), ranking,
     social position.
 * 保
   * The left side is a person (亻) and the right side comes from an archaic
     version of the kanji for child (子). It is a person carrying a child on
     their back. It means to raise, to support, or protect.
 * 仁
   * Again, left side is a person (亻), right side is the number 2 (二). It
     means two people close to each other, it signifies affection, charity,
     compassion.
 * 先
   * Composed by the radical for legs 儿 and the kanji 之 which is an old form
     for footprints. It represents the footprints of people that came before us,
     and it means “before” or “ahead”.
