# Language learning is a great excuse for escapism

Ever since I was little I've always loved reading books. I was a very early
reader: I remember learning to read when I was 3 by trying to hammer keys on
my old DOS computer to get into Windows so I could play with Paint (people my
generation who had a PC back then will understand). I slowly discovered what
each letter looked like on the keys and eventually figured out how to read like
that. Then, in elementary school, I got hooked on fantasy books (series like
Shannara) and my life has never been the same since. I remember my teachers
being annoyed at me for choosing to read books rather than play with other kids
during recess, but I really needed to know how the story ended and I was fully
immersed in that world.

As I grew up, in my teenage years, I began to read books in English. This was
mostly for two reasons:

 - The translation of some books I read in Italian was very wrong. While I
   appreciate and admire the work of translators, those books I read were really
   badly translated, and discovering the original work really opened a new world
   to me.
 - The English version was, ironically, cheaper to buy in the store. It was an
   age before digital reading and ebooks, and as a teenager with not a lot of
   money to spend, saving every penny helped. The English version was much
   cheaper than the Italian one, because not many people in Italy bought books
   in English at the time anyway.

On the side, while I was enjoying books, I also got into videogames and gaming,
mostly JRPGs. I've always been fascinated the most by the narrative and
storytelling rather than the gameplay. If a game has a good and compelling story
to me, it can be a great game even if the gameplay is mediocre. It's another
great chance to immerse and discover a new world, like an interactive book.

After graduating highschool, for a reason I don't really know, I somewhat grew away
from books and reading as a hobby. I spent most of my time doing game development
and programming, studied computer science in university, and got started in my
current career. I also nurtured my other hobby which is guitar and music
production.

A lot of my time in my 20s was spent traveling (for work), living abroad,
practicing music, and also playing **a lot** of CSGO. I don't think there was
any real reason why I grew away from reading but it just happened and I always
assumed it was a thing adults did. I've always heard people say "I don't have
time for reading as an adult" and similar excuses and I kinda internalized them
myself too.

Then, my late 20s/early 30s hit, and I got into Japanese learning. Japanese
learning changed my world once again (for the better or worse I can't tell yet,
but probably for the better). I was already familiar with the idea that if you
want to learn a language well you need to live it, and that the best way to
live it is by reading and immersing in that language's media, so that did not
come as a surprise to me.

What surprised me, however, was how **good** it felt to get back into reading as
a hobby without feeling like I was "wasting time". I could excuse my reading by
telling myself "It's for language learning" and just spend hours upon hours
immersed in manga, books, games, etc guilt free. It gave me back a feeling that
I had forgotten: the feeling of escaping the current world and joining adventures
and stories from faraway lands full of unknowns. It brought me back to my teenage
years of blissful fantasy reading and story-focused gaming.

Language learning is an amazing way to not only learn about a new culture and
interface yourself with a foreign world, but also to give yourself a chance to
catch a breath in this modern frantic world and tell yourself that it's okay to
just open a book and read. You owe it to yourself.

If you've never enjoyed reading, I think you're missing out and you should give
it another chance. If you used to enjoy reading and ended up growing away from
it, consider coming back. It is worth it.
