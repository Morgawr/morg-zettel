# Trying to memorize each kanji reading without knowing the words

When coming out of kana, people often have the assumption that kanji are just
some kind of “alphabet” that maps to a certain phonetic system, just like
hiragana and katakana do. However, in reality, kanji are read differently
depending on which words they are combined to create. Multiple kanji have
several different ways they could be read, including a lot of exceptions and
corner cases.

**Pros**:

 * Most advanced kanji have a very limited number of readings that usually map
   to very specific words, so memorizing **those** readings can be useful to
   remember those **words**

**Cons**:

 * Kanji have different readings for different words they appear in. Memorizing
   kanji readings just makes it harder on yourself, it’s a dreadful experience,
   and will not actually teach you useful Japanese (before you burn out at
   least)
 * The most common beginner kanji words will have very irregular readings more
   often than not because the more common a word is, the more likely it
   “slangified” and became irregular in the spoken language over time. This
    makes these words extremely hard to memorize by just memorizing readings.

**Conclusion:** Learn words instead. Do not try to memorize every single
[[[Onyomi-and-Kunyomi]]] for each kanji you study. Try to find words that use
those kanji with those specific readings **and learn those words**. At least
you’ll be actually learning useful Japanese if you do that.
