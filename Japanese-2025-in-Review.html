While I ended up going above that limit by about 50 hours (if we do not consider anki), I’d like to believe I managed to stick to a pretty consistent pace as can be seen by this <a href="static/moyase_2025_immersion.png">moyase burndown chart</a>.</p><p>You can see a more accurate graph breakdown by month and activity by looking at <a href="static/2025-review-graph1.png">this picture</a> and a total cumulative view from <a href="static/2025-review-graph2.png">this picture</a>.</p><p>As always, I also track all my content consumption activities on <a href="https://lingotrack.com/profile/Morg">my lingotrack account</a>.</p><p>A few highlights and comments I want to make about this year as a whole:</p><ul><li>I tried to reduce my Japanese consumption to prioritize other hobbies. I will admit this didn’t work as well as I hoped. I just love spending all my free time on Japanese media and it’s hard to cut back. This said, I did start some cool new projects like the <a href="https://yoku.bi/">yokubi grammar guide</a> and a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPbx0BirO2go_Diw7unXOCQ">youtube channel</a>.</li><li>I did a manga-volume-a-day reading challenge for the month of July, which is why my manga consumption time went up during that period. I also did a light novel reading challenge (20,000 characters per day) in August and it shows.</li><li>The month of August and November were my most “active” months. August is definitely because of the reading challenge. For November I don’t have a specific reason. I guess I just had some extra time on hand.</li><li>Early in the year I moved into my new house in what some would consider the “countryside”, and since then I’ve been interacting a lot more with both my Japanese family and other local businesses/activities. Having to deal with kindergarten stuff for my kid, talking to teachers every day, interacting with the local neighborhood association, etc. I do not track my output but I can confidently say that compared to last year I’ve been using Japanese way more in my every day life too.</li></ul><p>I go in more details about each media type in the following sections, or you can watch my <a href="https://youtu.be/45l0hyvuDYg">summary youtube video</a> although it’s kinda long.</p><h2 id="manga">Manga</h2><p>Just like in 2024, 2025 also was a relatively slow year for manga. I read most of my manga in burst in July as I did my one volume a day challenge. Throughout the year I also read a bit of shounen jump series (mostly ルリドラゴン and ケントゥリア).</p><p>In total, I have read 55 manga volumes (+ a lot of shounen jump).</p><p>Some of my favorite series I have read, with no particular order:</p><ul><li>あさドラ！</li><li>MUJINA INTO THE DEEP</li><li>エリオと電気人形</li><li>魔女と傭兵</li><li>終の退魔師 ―エンダーガイスター―</li></ul><h2 id="videogames">Videogames</h2><p>As usual, videogames are my main media choice of consumption and I really cannot get away from them. As I said last year, I was going to branch out to also some non-Japanese content, and I can say I have thoroughly enjoyed Expedition 33 and Silksong. Both amazing games. But we’re talking about Japanese here so let’s stay on track.</p><p>In 2025 I played a total of 14 videogames to completion, with one carry over into 2026 (Octopath Traveler 0).</p><table class="ui table"><thead><tr><th>Title</th><th>Playtime</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Yakuza Ishin!</td><td>34h28m</td></tr><tr><td>Atelier Ryza 1</td><td>44h16m</td></tr><tr><td>Fantasian Neo Dimension</td><td>59h16m</td></tr><tr><td>Granblue Fantasy: Relink</td><td>24h47m</td></tr><tr><td>Persona 3 Reload</td><td>75h06m</td></tr><tr><td>Yakuza Pirates in Hawaii</td><td>47h58m</td></tr><tr><td>Lunar 1 Remake</td><td>20h35m</td></tr><tr><td>Lunar 2 Remake</td><td>23h18m</td></tr><tr><td>Lost Odyssey</td><td>59h07m</td></tr><tr><td>Dragon Quest 3 HD Remake</td><td>32h52m</td></tr><tr><td>Pokemon Violet</td><td>36h41m</td></tr><tr><td>Bravely Default HD Remaster</td><td>50h27m</td></tr><tr><td>Trails in the Sky 1st Remake</td><td>67h43m</td></tr><tr><td>Ghost of Tsushima</td><td>41h38m</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Since 2023 I have been accurately tracking my currently played games in a spreadsheet and I only try to make myself play one game at a time. This year I am afraid I kinda slipped a bit as I started to play a few games in parallel and that made me drop and stop playing a bunch of them, to much of my shame. Some notable examples: Final Fantasy 13, Dragon Quest 11, Valkyrie Elysium. I just did not enjoy them as much to continue playing them, but I need to be more attentive to the time I dedicate to each of them rather than jump from game to game like I used to do in the past.</p><p>This said, back in August I ended up buying a “retro” Xbox One X so I could play some older Xbox 360 RPGs like Lost Odyssey, and I’m looking forward to playing Blue Dragon and Infinite Undiscovery next year.</p><p>Likewise, I got nerd sniped into some retro stuff and toward the end of the year I bought an old Dreamcast console. I’ve always been interested in some of the retro JRPGs and VNs on that console and I stocked up with some of my backlog touching games like Sakura Wars, Skies of Arcadia, and a bunch of other games which I hope to tackle next year.</p><h2 id="visual-novels">Visual Novels</h2><p>Continuing the trend from last year, I feel like I have finally grown into the Visual Novel genre as I enjoyed quite a bit of them this year too. I read a total of 5 VNs to completion (I did drop a couple along the way though):</p><table class="ui table"><thead><tr><th>Title</th><th>Playtime</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Kanade</td><td>13h47m</td></tr><tr><td>千の刃濤、桃花染の皇姫</td><td>47h12m</td></tr><tr><td>時計仕掛けのレイライン －黄昏時の境界線－</td><td>27h41m</td></tr><tr><td>白昼夢の青写真</td><td>61h34m</td></tr><tr><td>岩倉アリア</td><td>26h26m</td></tr></tbody></table><p>I go in more details on a few of them in my youtube video, but basically I can say I have thoroughly enjoyed most of them, aside from one specific side story in 白昼夢の青写真 which was insanely creepy to the point of almost souring the whole VN for me.</p><p>As for the rest, in 2024 I had read EVE: Burst Error and now with a new dreamcast waiting for me, I am planning to pick up some of the other VNs in the same franchise. I already bought EVE: The Lost One on PC which is a fairly controversial “sequel”, and I also got EVE: Zero on Dreamcast which is the prequel. I’m really looking forward to reading them, but that’s a story for next year.</p><h2 id="light-novels--books">Light Novels / Books</h2><p>Back in 2024 I had a few novel series that I was in the middle of reading. Majorly the 星界の紋章 and ある魔女が死ぬまで series. In 2025 I finished both, and some more of others. I have read a total of 12 books, and here they are:</p><ul><li>星界の紋章 2 and 3</li><li>ある魔女が死ぬまで 3 and 4</li><li>Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear volume 21</li><li>レーエンデ国物語</li><li>火狩りの王 main series (vol 1~4) and side story (vol 5)</li><li>転生吸血鬼さんはお昼寝がしたい 1 (yeah… we don’t talk about this slop)</li></ul><p>Overall I’d say my highlights of the year were the ある魔女が死ぬまで series which I really enjoyed the end, and 星界の紋章 which was… fairly hard but ended on a note that made me want to get into the main sequel 星界の戦旗.</p><p>The レーエンデ国物語 book was also very good from the point of view of someone who likes “proper” western-style fantasy series (not isekai). I plan to read the next books in the series too, once I get the time.</p><h2 id="anime">Anime</h2><p>I don’t really have much to say about anime anymore, unfortunately. I have been watching a bunch of stuff here and there, mostly one or two episodes a week during lunch break. I don’t actively look super deep into new anime releases, unless there’s something major coming out. I can say from recent memory I really enjoyed the Ranma 1/2 remake though. That was a very pleasant surprise that brought me back to my childhood. I’m also really looking forward to the new Madoka movie in 2026, but that’s a story for next year.</p><h2 id="plans-for-2026-and-the-future-ahead">Plans for 2026 and the future ahead</h2><p>As I mentioned, I ended 2024 with the idea of trying to hold back my Japanese time so I could dedicate more of my free time to other hobbies.</p><p>While I’d say the plan kinda worked, at the same time it made me realize that I would rather not do that and instead continue with more Japanese for 2026, so that’s where I stand right now. I have a fairly extensive backlog of games and novels I want to go through, so I think I will try to tackle that. I need to tackle my Dreamcast and Xbox backlog, while also keep up with new releases too.</p><p>This year taught me that it’s okay to also do stuff not in Japanese (like playing Expedition 33) so I might look into exploring new media and non-Japanese stuff, but I won’t force myself to do that via fake guardrails (like “no more than 1200 hours of Japanese” or whatever). I think last year’s challenge was fun and gave me some more strict discipline, but at the same time I can now move on from that.</p><p>From a personal project perspective, I want to refine and continue working on my yokubi grammar guide, maybe even introduce more special grammar points that I rarely hear talked about in other resources (We could call it yokuyokubi / 翌々日!) but first I need to finish the main guide.</p><p>I also want to work on my Youtube channel more. I’ve been using it as a way to build new skills both in public speaking and video editing because it sounds fun. I have no expectations to become a popular youtuber or even make stuff that people find interesting, necessarily, I just like talking in front of a camera and discuss various things that I am into, like when I write on this site. Ideally I’d like to post a minimum of one video a month, but I can’t make promises. I’d also like to start streaming on twitch more regularly again, ideally Japanese-related or Japanese-teaching related content, but with the way my life is structured now, streaming at home with a family and a young kid is difficult. I have also a couple of “secret” projects that I don’t feel ready to talk about yet. Maybe I’ll get to them next year, maybe not. They hang on a couple of fairly volatile variables in my life so I cannot make promises.</p><p>皆さん、今年もよろしくおねがいします</p></div><div class="metadata"><div class="date" title="Zettel date"><time datetime="2026-01-02T10:53">2026-01-02</time></div></div></article><nav class="ui attached segment deemphasized backlinksPane" id="neuron-backlinks-pane"><h3 class="ui header">Backlinks</h3><ul class="backlinks"><li><span class="zettel-link-container cf"><span class="zettel-link" title="2022-03-05T18:48"><a href="Diary">Diary</a></span></span><ul class="context-list" style="zoom: 85%;"><li class="item"><div class="pandoc"><span class="zettel-link-container cf"><span class="zettel-link" title="2026-01-02T10:53"><a href="Japanese-2025-in-Review">Japanese 2025 in Review</a></span></span></div></li></ul></li><li><span class="zettel-link-container cf"><span class="zettel-link" title="2021-10-22T09:44"><a href="Reddit-Notes">Reddit Notes</a></span></span><ul class="context-list" style="zoom: 85%;"></ul></li><li><span class="zettel-link-container cf"><span class="zettel-link" title="2021-05-29T22:59"><a href="Japanese">Japanese</a></span></span><ul class="context-list" style="zoom: 85%;"></ul></li><li><span class="zettel-link-container cf"><span class="zettel-link" title="2020-08-29T17:04"><a href="78550a77">Full Timeline</a></span></span><ul class="context-list" style="zoom: 85%;"></ul></li></ul></nav><nav class="ui attached segment deemphasized bottomPane" id="neuron-tags-pane"><div><span class="ui basic label zettel-tag" title="Tag">japanese</span><span class="ui basic label zettel-tag" title="Tag">personal</span><span class="ui basic label zettel-tag" title="Tag">reddit</span><span class="ui basic label zettel-tag" title="Tag">timeline</span></div></nav><nav class="ui bottom attached icon compact inverted menu grey" id="neuron-nav-bar"><!--replace-start-9--><a class="item" href="." title="Home"><i class="home icon"></i></a><!--replace-end-9--><a class="item" href="https://github.com/Morgawr/morg-zettel/edit/master/./Japanese-2025-in-Review.md" title="Edit this page"><i class="edit icon"></i></a><a class="right item" href="impulse" title="Open Impulse"><i class="wave square icon"></i></a></nav></div></div><!--replace-end-6--><!--replace-end-3--><!--replace-end-2--><div class="ui center aligned container footer-version"><div class="ui tiny image"><a href="https://neuron.zettel.page"><img alt="logo" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srid/neuron/master/assets/neuron.svg" title="Generated by Neuron 1.9.35.3" /></a></div></div></div></body></html>
