# Kanji Classification

There is one thing I want you all to remember after stumbling upon this page,
so I’ll add it right at the beginning: **not all kanji are created equal**.

## Index of articles

   * [[Kanji-that-represent-concrete-things]]
   * [[Kanji-that-tell-a-story]]

## Preface

This was originally intended to be a single article but the more I wrote, the
more I realized I had more to write about, and it eventually turned into its
own mini-series of articles. Feel free to skip ahead if you're curious about
a specific topic, but I recommend reading these pages in order starting from
this one for a more comprehensive experience.

## Introduction

Okay, with that out of the way, let’s talk kanji. A common misunderstanding
among Japanese learners and a very big pet peeve of mine is to consider all
kanji a single large group of similar  symbols. It would be nice if we could
just look at a kanji and make up a story in our head as to **why** this kanji
looks like that, and then attribute some meaning to it. However, unfortunately,
that is not how it works **for the vast majority of them**.

It doesn’t help that some kanji learning methods like Remembering The Kanji,
Wanikani, or KanjiDamage (to name a few) try to give you mnemonics to better
remember and recognize the shapes, and then people roll with it thinking that’s
all there is to it. **While I have nothing against using mnemonic tricks to remember kanji**,
it is very important to be aware that such methods are just memorization tricks.
There’s no actual basis that is grounded in reality for such mnemonics to exist.
It’s better to not think of it as a one-solution-fits-all situation because
there is no single mental model that will encompass all kanji types uniformly.

On the other hand, by learning to recognize some simple kanji categories, we
unlock the ability to apply a more appropriate study method to each of them as
we see fit. Mental flexibility is the key to language acquisition, after all.

If you want a quick summary of what I’m going to be writing about, and prefer to
have a video format, I recommend watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOj4zOcNdak)
which does a decent job at summing up the contents of this page. However I will
go into more details here so I recommend you keep reading nonetheless.

### A quick note on radicals

As you probably already know, all kanji have one “main” component called a
radical (<ruby>部首<rt>ぶしゅ</rt></ruby>). There are 214 of them and they help
us classify kanji in some sort of order to more easily look them up in a paper
dictionary. Contrary to expectations, radicals are not going to be the main
focus of this article so I won’t go in too many details about them and how they
work, but if you are interested I recommend giving [this page](https://kanjialive.com/214-traditional-kanji-radicals/)
a quick read. Be aware that a lot of kanji learning resources out there like
making up their own radicals or “components”. As useful as they might be for you
to remember them, they are completely useless when it comes to actually talking
about kanji in a formal manner, so it’s better not to confuse the two. They are
very different.

## Four Types of Kanji

In the 2nd century AD, a Chinese scholar by the name of Xu Shen compiled a
dictionary of Chinese characters and divided them in 6 categories he called
<ruby>六書<rt>りくしょ</rt></ruby> (reading in Japanese for simplification
purposes and because I don't know Chinese).

For utilitarian reasons, we can completely ignore two of those categories as
they are a bit questionable, and focus instead on the remaining four. For all
intents and purposes, all kanji can be divided into the following four types
depending on their structural composition:
 * Non-decomposable types (<ruby>分解<rt>ぶんかい</rt></ruby>できない)
   * <ruby>指事文字<rt>しじもじ</rt></ruby>
   * <ruby>象形文字<rt>ぞうけいもじ</rt></ruby>
 * Decomposable types (<ruby>分解<rt>ぶんかい</rt></ruby>できる)
   * <ruby>会意文字<rt>かいいもじ</rt></ruby>
   * <ruby>形声文字<rt>けいせいもじ</rt></ruby>

As the name implies, decomposable kanji are kanji that can be separated into
multiple components. Non-decomposable ones on the other hand are individual
units that cannot be further separated.

Let’s start by looking at non-decomposable ones because they are simpler and
there's fewer of them, then move on to the more complex ones later.
