# Using machine translators (Google, Deepl, etc)

Dealing with uncertainty and not understanding sentences is sometimes scary and
people like to have confirmation of what a sentence they are reading *actually*
means or if their understanding is correct. For this reason, it’s common for
beginners to use machine translators (MTL) as a tool to get more "complete"
understanding.

**Pros**:

 * In case of emergency or uncertainty, especially when dealing with IRL
   problems, Google Translate can be very useful
 * The OCR recognition of Google Translate/Google Lens is really good, it can be
   useful to recognize unknown kanji

**Cons**:

 * MTLs do **not** know how to deal with incorrect Japanese. They assume
   whatever garbage you type in the box is “correct” and try to find whatever
   meaning they can grab, whether it makes sense or not
 * MTL language is extremely unnatural, wrong or extremely misleading
 * When going from English to Japanese Google translate will often just pick
   some random katakana word that sounds similar to the English one, regardless
   of it being correct or not
 * Japanese is a very contextual language and doesn’t have gendered words or
   obvious pronouns most of the time. It also doesn’t have a distinction between
   singular or plural. For this reason most MTLs are simply unable to cope with
   the lack of context or unable to infer the context from the text, so they
   will make up some stuff (gender, plurality, etc) and it will often be wrong
 * It’s very common for Google Translate to completely **drop** entire pieces of
   sentences it doesn’t know how to translate. What’s even worse, it won’t tell
   you it did that.

**Conclusion:** For advanced learners, some **very** targeted/specific usage of
MTL can be useful (for example to “double check” some J-J definitions). It’s
also okay to use Google translate if you’re in an emergency and just need to
quickly communicate or figure out what a sign or button or something says in
real life (like if you’re stuck in an elevator, etc). For every other situation,
just forget MTL even exists. Stop using it. Stop relying on it. It’s misleading,
wrong, and a bad habit you should avoid as much as possible. If you need help
understanding what certain words or phrases mean, you should first and foremost
check in a dictionary, then check on google **search** for articles explaining
them (in case of jargon or slang), and if it’s still confusing to you try to
find someone to help you (like a teacher, Japanese friend, or language learning
discord servers). Also embrace the fact that you can’t 100% understand
everything and if your understanding doesn’t quite match it’s okay too, if it’s
a problem you’ll figure out from the context later. Also read [[22ae9630]].
