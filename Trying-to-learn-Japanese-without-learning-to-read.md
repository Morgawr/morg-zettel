# Trying to learn Japanese without learning to read

Some people only care about being able to converse with native speakers and have
no interest in reading books or similar written media. Because of this, they
convince themselves they don’t need the written language and can just get by
with listening/speaking practice only.

**Pros**:

 * Kanji are one of the biggest hurdles for new learners, so avoiding kanji will
   cut out a significant chunk of “study”

**Cons**:

 * There’s not many listening-focused resources, and the few that exist are
   extremely sketchy or with dodgy results (for example Pimsleur)
 * Reading is actually one of the **best** ways to obtain a wide and varied
   vocabulary and build language intuition. If you actively avoid reading you
   will have a much harder time acquiring the language compared to someone that
   reads.

**Conclusion:** Unless you have a live-in tutor or someone available to feed you
spoken comprehensible input all the time and guide you through the process of
learning the language the spoken way, it will be **much much harder** to learn
Japanese without touching the written language than it would be easier for you
to just learn to read it like everyone else does. It’s counter-intuitive but
that’s how it is. Don’t skip reading, you’d just be causing yourself more
troubles than it’s worth it.
