# Japanese

The Japanese learning community is incredibly resourceful, and it can be quite
daunting for a beginner to know where to start.

My intention for this **personal** section of my site is to contextualize
various resources scattered everywhere and record a heterogeneous learning
method to make sense of Japanese.

There are no plans to make this a thorough and comprehensive repository, just
a place to dump all kind of scattered knowledge.

If you have any complaints or comments about it or the site as a whole, you can
find me on the [[EJLX]] server.
