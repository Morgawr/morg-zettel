# Japanese

The Japanese learning community is incredibly resourceful ([[9f88358f]]), and
it can be quite daunting for a beginner to know where to start.

My intention for this folgezettel heterarchy is to contextualize various
resources scattered all over the web and record a heterogeneous learning
approach following the path that I myself have been following during my journey
of learning Japanese.

There are no plans to make this a thorough and comprehensive repository, just
a place to dump all kind of scattered knowledge.

If you're looking for a good starting point to learn Japanese, here is my

If you are interested in the Japanese writing system then I recommend starting
from [[Kanji]].
