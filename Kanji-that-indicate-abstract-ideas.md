# 指事文字 - Kanji that indicate abstract ideas

<ruby>指事文字<rt>しじもじ</rt></ruby> are kanji whose shape offers some visual
representation of abstract ideas or concepts. Some of them are obvious on a
first look, like 一, 二, 三. Some others are not as obvious, like 本 or 末, but
at the end of the day if you can remember the **reason** why they look like this
and **what** they visualize, they are great for a mnemonic based approach. By
just looking at them, you’ll be able to retain their meaning.

## Examples

 * 一, 二, 三
   * The simplest kanji, they are just numbers. Just count the number of
     horizontal lines
 * 本
   * While this kanji can be read as ほん (book) in onyomi, we need to focus on
     the kunyomi that is もと (origin, source). This kanji looks like a tree
     (木) with a horizontal line at the bottom, pointing at the tree roots (the
     origin of the tree).
 * 末
   * Likewise, this kanji means すえ (end, tip, top). Take the same tree (木) as
     before, but this time instead strike a horizontal line at the top.
 * 上, 下
   * These ones are also quite straightforward. One points up, the other points
     down.

## Exceptions

Unfortunately, since languages aren’t perfect, there are exceptions. The kanji
四 for example is <ruby>指事文字<rt>しじもじ</rt></ruby> but its origin does not
have the same meaning that we attribute to it in modern day (four). Originally,
it represented “breathing”, as the kanji shows it’s an open mouth (口) with
tongue and teeth.

Likewise for 八, it originally represented two lines separating, and its
original meaning was to “separate” (分かれる). It only later got re-assigned
the meaning of eight.

Fortunately, <ruby>指事文字<rt>しじもじ</rt></ruby> are among the least common
and most unique-looking kanji, so they should be relatively easy to remember
without much trouble since they stand out from the rest.
