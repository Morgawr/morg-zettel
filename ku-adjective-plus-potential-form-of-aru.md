# 〜くあれる

The first time you encouter this it feels kinda cursed, but you envetually
start to understand how it works.

First, we need a quick grammar refresher on how い adjectives work and
especially how their negative conjugation works.

おいしい = delicious

おいしくない = not delicious

The conjugation turns the adjective into an adverb (おいしく) + the verb ある in
the negative form (ない). Furthermore, we can define い adjectives attached to
the verb ある like おいしくはある to mean "It is (at least) おいしい". The い
trailing part of the adjective can be replaced with くある to mostly mean the
same thing.

This said, normally you wouldn't put ある in potential form, however in this
kind of usage it can work, as seen in these examples:

君らしく在れない場所 = "A place where you cannot be 君らしい"

誇り高くあれる = "You can be 誇り高い"
