# いいってことにしよ

I hear this phrase all the time in real life but I'm actually not sure if I've
ever encountered it when reading. It's a colloquial phrase that basically means
"let's call it a day" or "meh, good enough" or similar vibes. You kinda say it
when you're doing something and the outcome is a bit テキトー but you can't be
arsed putting more effort into it.

I hear it often as [まあいっか](https://koganienglish.com/maaiika/)、これでいいってことにしよ

I tried to look for examples in the wild but I couldn't find any relevant one,
but [this article](https://ameblo.jp/syu912kana/entry-12712850407.html) does use
that phrase.
