# Yokubi

[Yokubi](https://yoku.bi/) is a project I wrote and maintain. It is an immersion
focused Japanese grammar guide for beginners, and is the spiritual successor of
[sakubi](https://sakubi.neocities.org/). It is mostly re-write of sakubi with
better phrasing, examples, explanations, and some additional content.
