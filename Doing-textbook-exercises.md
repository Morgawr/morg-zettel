# Doing textbook exercises ("Fill in the particles", etc)

Most textbooks have a series of exercises to test the student’s knowledge by
having them perform substitution work like providing a sample template of a
sentence and have it apply to different situations with different particles,
verbs, and nouns.

**Pros**:

 * It makes the learner think about the rules of the grammar and how to put
   things together

**Cons**:

 * It’s mostly a waste of time. Especially early on, forcing people to put
   together sentences like pieces of lego or fill in blanks of a template
   sentence does not help their language skills very much. It’s a common myth.
 * Exercises like this can be very frustrating, especially if the student
   doesn’t have a good “feeling” for the language yet and is not familiar with
   how things are supposed to look or sound like. It’s just banging your head
   against a wall hoping something sticks. It can be very demotivating
 * Some exercises are very confusing or oddly phrased, especially as a self
   learner without a teacher to help it can lead to misunderstandings and
   unnecessary confusion

**Conclusion:** Don’t do grammar exercises. If you like learning grammar from a
textbook, there’s nothing wrong with that. Just skip the exercises. If you don’t
believe me, listen to what [Steve Kaufmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Kaufmann)
has to [say about it](https://youtu.be/rmIa1v1BNkY?t=61). He explains it a
thousand times better than I ever could.
