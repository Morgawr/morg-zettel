# Japanese Learning Resources

This is a mostly scattered collection of sites, tooling, and all kind of things
that can help you learn [[[5e00df06]]].

## Comprehensive Guides

### [Itazuraneko](https://itazuraneko.neocities.org/)

4chan's /djt/ (Daily Japanese Thread) guide. I don't think it's very
beginner friendly but it has *a lot* of content and sections for all kind of
topics on how to learn Japanese.

### [Mass Immersion's Approach](https://massimmersionapproach.com/table-of-contents/stage-1/jp-quickstart-guide/)

MIA's specific quick start guide on how to study Japanese using the
[[4f5f4e00]] tools and resources. MIA's focus is on extensive immersion and
natural acquisition of the language. It's definitely worth checking it out.

### [r/LearnJapanese Beginner Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/wiki/index/startersguide)

The official beginner's wiki for the Japanese learning subreddit.

While personally I would not recommend spending too much time on the subreddit,
their wiki is a decent entry point before branching off in your studies.

## Textbooks

### [Genki](http://genki.japantimes.co.jp/index_en)

The go-to de-facto textbook for Japanese beginners that want to learn in a
classroom-like setting with structured lessons and workbook exercises.

Pretty much everyone will tell you to get Genki if you want to start learning
Japanese. Personally, I'm not a big fan and I prefer the Japanese for Busy
People series, however I seem to be in the minority.

### [Japanese For Busy People](https://www.ajalt.org/english/textbooks/japanese_for_busy_people.html)

Another textbook like Genki with a classroom-like lesson structure. It covers
about the same topics as Genki, and personally it's what I've used myself. I
would recommend it over Genki as I found it to have a better format, but overall
they are very similar. Get the kana version, don't even bother with the romaji
one([[99eaf9c2]]).

### [Japanese the Manga Way](https://www.tofugu.com/reviews/japanese-the-manga-way/)

This textbook is very interesting to me. It attempts to provide some kind of
crash course to Japanese grammar by real world examples of manga snippets.
It's great for beginners and covers a surprisingly large amount of grammar
condensed into a relatively low number of pages. I used it mostly to learn
basic particles and sentence structure as a beginner and it carried me a long
way, surprisingly.

### [An Introduction to Modern Japanese](https://books.google.co.jp/books/about/An_Introduction_to_Modern_Japanese_Volum.html?id=Gu3k3eiOXWAC&redir_esc=y)

Relatively old (2004?) and hard to come by textbook. I include it here because
albeit extremely expensive for what it's worth and hard to find online, it
provides a very "different" approach to modern Japanese learning practices.
The book itself is very intensive and is not afraid to jump into complex
Japanese from the get go, every chapter is introduced with a quite meaty
block of conversation/text to immerse in. No furigana, extensive use of kanji.
It definitely does not hold a beginner's hand through its material, but I found
it to be very interesting and appreciated it for what it is.

Definitely **not** essential, but if you can get your hands on a copy as a side
read it can be quite an experience.

### [Tobira](http://tobiraweb.9640.jp/introduction/%e3%80%8e%e3%81%a8%e3%81%b3%e3%82%89%e3%80%8f%e3%81%ae%e7%89%b9%e5%be%b4/)

Following Genki, this seems to be the de-facto material to use. I see this being
recommended every time after someone finishes with their Genki studies, although
I have never tried it myself.

## Grammar

### [An Introduction to Japanese](https://pomax.github.io/nrGrammar/)

Probably one of my favorite grammar overviews of the Japanese language.
It's great for looking up structure and grammar to get a thorough and
extensive mental map of how the Japanese language works.

It is not to be used as a beginner resources or as a learning textbook. I like
to re-read it once in a while as my language knowledge improves to further
cement the fundamentals and broaden my understanding.


### [Imabi](https://www.imabi.net/)

This site is *crazy*. There's pretty much *everything* you may want to know
about the Japanese language grammar.

However, it's extremely verbose and can be very confusing/convoluted in the
explanations even for the simplest grammatical concepts. It's great to look up
individual grammar points if you want to get the finer intricacies and
subtleties of the language, but I wouldn't use it as a textbook alone.

### [Tae Kim](http://www.guidetojapanese.org/learn/)

Often proclaimed as *the* entry point to learn Japanese grammar for beginners.
I personally haven't used it much and I've read a lot of criticism about the way
he approaches some explanations (sometimes even incorrectly). Overall, it seems
to work really well for a lot of people so it must be doing some things right at
least.

### [Cure Dolly's Video Series](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkdmU8hGK4Fg3LghTVtKltQ)

While I am not a fan of the video format and the way Dolly speaks (still not
sure if it's a filter, an act of playing a character, or what), I think the
way they approach the Japanese grammar is great and it's one of the best
attempts at providing a "non-westernized"/English look at Japanese.

It's perfect if you want to get into Japanese grammar the way it's taught to
Japanese people (allegedly?), not filtered through the typical English-speaking
classroom setting.

### [A dictionary of Basic/Intermediate/Advanced Japanese Grammar](https://www.tofugu.com/reviews/dictionary-of-basic-japanese-grammar/)

These three books are exactly what the name implies. A literal dictionary of all
possible grammar points in the Japanese language. Use them to look up individual
grammar points, they are *really* good.

I believe if anyone is even remotely serious about learning the language, these
are absolutely **essential** to have. I prefer them on paper but there are
digital version too.
