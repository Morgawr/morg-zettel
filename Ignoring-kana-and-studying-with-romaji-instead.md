# Ignoring kana and studying with romaji instead

The Japanese writing system can feel very intimidating when you’re first
starting out. For this reason, a lot of people tend to avoid learning the
writing systems as much as possible and instead try to learn using resources
that use romaji (Japanese written using the latin alphabet).

**Pros**:

 * Literally none.

**Cons**:

 * You need to learn how to read eventually, there’s no reason to postpone it
   for later
 * Romaji can imprint bad pronunciation habits in your head. Some people tend to
   pronounce sounds incorrectly because they visualize them in their head using
   the latin alphabet and mimic how they would pronounce them in their language.
 * Most resources that use romaji are sloppy, incorrect, or have very sketchy
   authors. For this reason, if you stick with romaji you will almost certainly
   end up using bad resources and your Japanese learning will suffer because of
   it.

**Conclusion:** You should really learn hiragana and katakana. They are not as
complicated as they look and most people can probably get decent at them in a
few weeks. Just practice them a bit every day and you’ll be fine. Actively
avoiding romaji as much as possible early on will also make it easier for you to
get used to reading kana (and kanji later).
