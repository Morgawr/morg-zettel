# Learning Japanese by studying song lyrics

Music is fun, and a lot of people get hooked on Japanese because they want to
understand what their favorite singer is singing about. For this reason, they
decide they are going to learn Japanese by listening to their songs under the
premise of “immersion learning”.

**Pros**:

 * Songs make it easier to remember certain words or catchy phrases, because
   they get stuck in our brain with the melody. They are a great way to easily
   remember **some** words.

**Cons**:

 * The Japanese in songs is extremely abstract. Japanese is a very contextual
   language and a lot of song lyrics are lacking context or are extremely
   ambiguous on purpose. Song lyrics are hard to interpret even for native
   speakers.
 * They often use awkward/weird/poetic style of grammar and word choice. They
   are not a good model of natural “common” language.
 * Song lyrics skew towards more poetic and uncommon words. There are certain
   words that are pronounced in a certain way only in songs but almost never in
   real life. The accent and cadence of words is also often different from
   conversational Japanese.

**Conclusion:** You should listen to Japanese music if you enjoy it and you will
naturally pick up a few words here and there. They can be very motivating when
you finally figure out what a phrase or word means in a song  you like.
However, it is **not** good to sit down and actually study song lyrics and
should be avoided.
