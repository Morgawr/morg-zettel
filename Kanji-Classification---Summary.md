If you made it this far, congratulations. Either that, or you decided to skip
ahead to the summary (which is also understandable). If so, welcome!

Here is a quick summary of the points mentioned in the previous series of
articles. I'll be as brief as I can.

There are 4 main typologies of kanji + 2 additional meta typologies. All six of
them together are called <ruby>六書<rt>りくしょ</rt></ruby>.

<ruby>指事文字<rt>しじもじ</rt></ruby> are kanji whose shape represents abstract
ideas or concepts:
 * 一 is the number **one** because it’s just one line.
 * 下 is an arrow pointing **down**.

<ruby>象形文字<rt>ぞうけいもじ</rt></ruby> are kanji whose shape depicts a
concrete object or natural phenomenon:
 * 木 looks like a **tree**
 * 目 looks like an **eye**

<ruby>会意文字<rt>かいいもじ</rt></ruby> are kanji that tell a story via its
components:
 * 休 is a man **resting** under a tree
 * 森 is a **forest** made from a lot of trees

<ruby>形声文字<rt>けいせいもじ</rt></ruby> are the most common (>90%) among
all kanji and they are composed of one semantic and one phonetic component:
 * 語 is a kanji that relates to speaking (言) and is pronounced ゴ (五)
 * 泡 is a kanji that relates to water (氵) and is pronounced ホウ (包)

Among <ruby>形声文字<rt>けいせいもじ</rt></ruby> there are some groups of
phonetic components that form **perfect series** that will let you predict the
sound they make with 100% accuracy:
 * 付 is read フ and so are all the following kanji: 付 府 符 腐 附

Not all 形声文字 are perfect series.

And finally...

The last two meta-categories are:
 * <ruby>転注文字<rt>てんちゅうもじ</rt></ruby>
   * 楽 means music, but since music is pleasant to listen to and it makes us
     happy, it also acquired the meaning of happiness.
 * <ruby>仮借文字<rt>かしゃくもじ</rt></ruby>
   * 来 used to mean “wheat” and 麦 used to mean “coming”, but since they were
     read the same way (らい) they eventually swapped meaning. Now 来 means
     “coming” and 麦 means “wheat”.

That’s all! I hope you enjoyed this series of articles about kanji
classification and I hope I was able to dispel a lot of myths and misconceptions
you might have had about kanji.
