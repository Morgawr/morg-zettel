# Doing exercises that ask you to fix incorrect Japanese

I’ve seen some teachers assign these kinds of **absolutely evil and
reprehensible** exercises to their students. If you are a teacher and do this,
you are a **TERRIBLE** teacher. There, I said it.

**Pros**:

 * Absolutely none.

**Cons**:

Literally everything. This is one of the worst things **anyone** could ever do
to their language learning career. Especially for beginners, correcting a
language that you don’t already know or have a “feel” for is impossible. What is
actually going to happen is you get stuck on some incorrect or weird phrases
and your brain might even subconsciously pick them up.

**Conclusion:** Absolutely do **not** do this. If you have a teacher that tells
you to do this, you should show them this page or tell them to message me and I
will talk to them myself. Seriously, I’m 100% serious here. It is a **bad**
exercise, it hurts your language learning.
